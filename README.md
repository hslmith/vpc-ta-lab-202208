# VPC Tech Academy Lab
### URLS Needed in this Mini Lab
- [IBM Cloud Portal](http://cloud.ibm.com)
- [This Lab Repo](https://github.com/hslmith/vpc-mini-lab)



## Login to IBM Cloud Portal

Decide on a Region to create this demo and keep a mental note: US South (Dallas) or US East Washington DC<br>
I have chosen **Dallas us-south** for this lab 


## Navigate to VPC Infrastructure in IBM Cloud Portal
1. Click top left hamburger menu  
2. Scroll down to **VPC Infrastructure**
3. Click the Pin next to VPC Infrastructure to pin the menu option to the top.
4. Choose **Overview** within the **VPC Infrastructure** menu. This will take you into the VPC landing page.


## Create a SSH Key in the IBM Cloud Portal
>Before you can add a key in the IBM Cloud console, you must make your SSH key available. Your SSH key must be an RSA key with a key size of either 2048 bits or 4096 bits.


Copy the [public key](pubkey_rsa) from the github repo.

1. Expand the Compute Menu and select ‘SSH Keys’
2. Choose your region that you want to complete this lab in from the drop down in the header.
3. Click blue “Create +” 
4. SSH Keys are stored at the regional level. Confirm you have the correct region selected. Make sure it is set to the region you started with.
	
>Name: minilab<br>
>Resource Group: Default<br>
>Public Key: Paste the public key you either created in the optional section above(id_rsa.pub) or copy and paste (pubkey_rsa) from github<br>
